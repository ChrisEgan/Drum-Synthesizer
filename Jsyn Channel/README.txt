JSyn is a library that handles much of the more complicated aspects of audio processing such as multithreading, sample io, and fx processing. Gabe and I decieded it would be best to switch to this library rather than the standard java audio library. However we werent able to create a class that could play samples today. At the unix lab I was able to create a test that compiled but produced errors on execution. These errors are detailed in the error log. If someone wants to try compiling the source code and running on their machine we can determine whether its a problem with the lab computers or not.
