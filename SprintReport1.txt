Sprint Report #1Drum Synthesizer Team Trill BeatsOctober 27Actions to stop doing:-We would be better off if we didn’t wait until the last couple days to compile our  individual branches into a working piece of software. Actions to start doing:-We need to find a better medium of group communication besides texting and group emails. Group texting is unreliable and texting individual people is tedious. Group emails have not proved too reliable for us because some team members aren’t receiving them. Actions to keep doing:-We all have been cooperating with each other in a very friendly and productive manner. Work completed:-As a digital artist, I want an intuitive interface that allows me to quickly add and subtract percussive elements to/from my session so that I can quickly sketch out musical ideas.Work not completed:-As a percussive musician, I want to be able to modularly add sampled elements to my composition so that I can use them to create full drum loops and breaks.- As a sound designer, I want percussive modules who's volume can be changed so that I can balance the volume of samples that may be too low or high.Work completion rate:
