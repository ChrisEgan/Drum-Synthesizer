Team Trill BeatsTest Plan	Opening a file:Opening different files besides .wav to make sure the program can handle this exception. Opening very big files.Play Button:Playing the sampler without loading a file to make sure it can handle this exception. Playing the sampler with a loaded .wav file to make sure it will play. Volume slider:Print the slider value associated with volume to make sure it is going up and down when the user uses the slider. Using qualitative testing with our ears as we vary the volume slider.
