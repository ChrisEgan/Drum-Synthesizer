WHAT THINGS SHOULD WE START DOING
- Ask each other for help if we find ourselves stuck. 	
- Start earlier on our tasks.

WHAT IS WORKING WELL THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE DOING
- Breaking down tasks to more manageable parts.
- Division of labor for required documentation.


WHAT WORK WAS COMPLETED
1) As a digital artist and computer application user, I want a polished user interface so that I can use it without impediments to my creativity such as having to work around 
bugs and learn idiosyncrasies of the application. 8 story points/15 work hours
	- Add borders to channel pannels
	- Add labels to sliders and channels

2) As a percussive musician, I want an interface through which to sequence drum sounds as well as be able to alter the tempo of the sequencer's playback and add swing so that I
can create a variety of styles of drum loops. 5 story points/10 work hours
	- Create sequencer pannel with 16 beats (1 bar)

3) As a sound designer, I want to access to simple effects such as reverb so that I can apply them to percussive modules and create more interesting percussive elements. 3 story points/4 work hours
	- no part of this completed

4) As a digital artist, I want to be able to export my compositions to audio files that I can use in a digital audio workstation. 3 story points/6 work hours (strech goal)
	- no part of this completed

WHAT WORK WAS NOT COMPLETED
- As a digital artist and computer application user, I want a polished user interface so that I can use it without impediments to my creativity such as having to work around 
bugs and learn idiosyncrasies of the application.
	- Didn't get to adding new project button, spent time polishing other areas of interface before adding new features

- As a percussive musician, I want an interface through which to sequence drum sounds as well as be able to alter the tempo of the sequencer's playback and add swing so that 
I can create a variety of styles of drum loops.
	- Didn't get to adding tempo/swing sliders due to unexpected complexity of multithreading

- As a sound designer, I want to be able to control the synthesis parameters of each synth module so that I can create interesting percussive elements.
	- Didn't get to making sustain work correctly due to lack of jsyn library documentation 

- As a sound designer, I want to access to simple effects such as reverb so that I can apply them to percussive modules and create more interesting percussive elements.
	- Didn't get to adding any effects, too time consuming to implement, spent time in other areas of project

- As a digital artist, I want to be able to export my compositions to audio files that I can use in a digital audio workstation. 3 story points/6 work hours (strech goal)
	- Didn't have time to reach this optional goal
