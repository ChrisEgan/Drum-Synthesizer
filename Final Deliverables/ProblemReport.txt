Problem Report:

Features Planned but Unimplemented:

1) As a sound designer, I want to be able to control the synthesis parameters of each synth module so that I can create interesting percussive elements.
 - didn't get to making sustain work correctly due to lack of jsyn library documentation 

2) As a digital artist and computer application user, I want a polished user interface so that I can use it without impediments to my creativity such as having to work around bugs and learn idiosyncrasies of the application.
 - didn't get to adding new project button, spent time polishing other areas of interface before adding new features

3) As a percussive musician, I want an interface through which to sequence drum sounds as well as be able to alter the tempo of the sequencer's playback and add swing so that I can create a variety of styles of drum loops.
 - didn't get to adding tempo/swing sliders due to unexpected complexity of multithreading

4) As a sound designer, I want to access to simple effects such as reverb so that I can apply them to percussive modules and create more interesting percussive elements.
 - didn't get to adding any effects, too time consuming to implement, spent time in other areas of project

Exceptions/Bugs

1) Synthesized tones experience extreme latency and sound choppy. Problem worsened when played from sequencer.

2) Sequencer sometimes stops and starts unexpectedly, likely due to accrued latency over time.

3) Lowpass filter does not work on synthesized noise sounds.

4) Attack/release parameters have minute effects on volume envelope of synthesized tones

5) Playing a sample throws messages from JSYN library that mixing block connections already exist. No effect of performance.

6) Resizing window causes interface components to become obscured or invisible.
